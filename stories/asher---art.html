        <p class="text-paragraph">FLINT — As Steven Barber made his way south on Saginaw Street, it was clear he knew Flint, Michigan, and its people intimately. He popped his head into stores, waved at workers he recognized through the front window and had something to say about almost every mural and building.<br><br>Barber is the president of the Flint Public Art Project, a non-profit organization aimed at easing blight through commissioning local, national and international artists to paint murals around the city, he has documented hundreds of the city&#x27;s community art pieces and became familiar with its art community.<br><br>When he approached the empty intersection with University Avenue, two cars got into a rage fueled altercation and began loudly honking at each other, interrupting his train of thought.<br><br>“That is not Flint. Flint is so much better than that,” said Barber. <br><br>Over the last half century, Flint has developed a reputation for being an unpleasant place. From the exodus of General Motors in the ‘80s and ‘90s that caused white flight and left the majority of the city unemployed, to ranking among the highest in violent crime for around a decade in the ‘00s and ‘10s, to the water crisis which began in 2014, good news has scant come out of Flint on a national level.<br><br>“I don&#x27;t know how many cities have had continuous crises over and over again since the 1970s. We&#x27;ve had just incredible bad luck,” said Greg Fielder, President and CEO of the Greater Flint Arts Council or GFAC. <br><br>Lesser known are the many positives to the city that around 80,000 people call home. <br><br>Flint, with its resilient people, has been an incubator for a public art community that has blossomed from its troubled past and the water crisis in the last 10 years. <br><br>“It gained popularity, because it was the one thing that was able to thrive, and more people got involved in it. I think the whole point of the Flint Public Art Project when it started was to bring in different people and to bring in a different image,” said Chuck Gruden, president of Friends of Modern Art, an organization that puts on the yearly Flint Art Fair, an event that helps to build funds for the acquisition of modern pieces at the Flint Institute of Arts.<br><br>Sandra Branch, board member for the Flint Public Art Project and director of Gallery on the Go!, a similar, less organized public mural organization, was a key art activist during the water crisis.<br><br>“It was victimhood. We wanted to escape victimhood. We had been the crime capital, murder capital, the place that everybody ran from… We started by painting different images that would give hope and using colors that are known to cause a chemical reaction in a person&#x27;s brain,” said Branch.<br><br>The Public Art Project was started around 2011-2012 by Steven Sacks, a business executive in the arts world from Brooklyn, New York who managed to land a $250,000 dollar grant from the National Endowment For the Arts. It became an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in 2018 and has commissioned around 350 murals total. About 200 or so are still active today. <br><br>“The city of Flint has had a huge issue with blight and abandonment and neglect over the years. One of our goals was to really help alleviate that issue. If a building is going to be abandoned, let&#x27;s give it some color so that it&#x27;s not an eyesore so much and there&#x27;s something that can be appreciated about it,” said Barber. <br><br>Flint was the birthplace of General Motors or GM, and grew in population largely because of the factories that employed hundreds of thousands of people. When GM decided to close down many of its factories in the ‘80s and ‘90s, problems ensued as the city no longer had an economy to prop it up. <br><br>“People started to leave and flight began from the city. People just left their homes open. Didn&#x27;t sell them… That&#x27;s how we ended up with over 1100 abandoned open homes in Flint,” said Branch.<br><br>As time went on and the population and economy continued to decline, Flint became known for the high rates of violent crime.<br><br>“When I originally moved to Flint in the early ‘80s, the image of it was, there was crime. It was a big city then. It was probably … 175 to 200,000 residents. So it was kind of known as, ‘you can go downtown, but you can&#x27;t go anywhere else,’ because of all the crime,” said Gruden.<br><br>This was and still is a piece of the reputation of Flint. While this was going on, the 2008 recession hit the city hard and on April 24, 2014, the water crisis began.<br><br>It happened because the city, under unelected state level emergency management, decided to switch the water supply from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, which had overcharged the city for its water for decades, to an old treatment facility that pulled water from the polluted Flint River. This was a bandage fix to save money while the new Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline was being built from Lake Huron.<br><br>The facility hadn&#x27;t been up to standard since the 1950s and did not treat the water with the proper chemicals to prevent the old infrastructure and pipes from corroding. Lead and PFAS leached into the water supply along with legionella, the bacteria which causes legionnaires disease, a deadly type of pneumonia. <br><br>“When they first switched it over, you could already taste the difference in it. The city tried passing out water filters for everybody. Everybody bought water filters for their refrigerators, but that just wasn&#x27;t cutting it either. And so we still buy bottled water. A lot of it,” said Alphonso Foster, a life-long Flint resident, sand and snow sculptor and fine artist.<br><br>Residents were told that the water was safe to drink for 18 months by local, state and national government, despite it sometimes having a pungent odor and a brown hue.<br><br>Branch became affiliated with the Flint Public Art Project around 2014 when the water crisis began. <br><br>“We saw that other people were doing art, art activism, and we decided to collaborate with a lot of them… We got a diversity of voices and projects, just to make sure that the word was out and that they wouldn&#x27;t just bring us bottled water and say, ‘Okay, we did our due.’ No. We wanted the problem fixed. We wanted it addressed. We didn&#x27;t want celebrities coming to get click bait and ‘look what I&#x27;ve done. I brought bottled water to Flint people.’ No. That made us bigger victims. And we didn&#x27;t want free water. And we didn&#x27;t want the jobs in Flint to be distributing water. No. We wanted clean water coming out our faucets,” said Branch.<br><br>She recalled a mural by local Flint artist Kevin Burdick or ‘Scraps,’ that featured Amariyanna Copeny or ‘Little Miss Flint,’ the young girl who wrote a letter to Barack Obama asking him to come to Flint to help with relief, sharing a smiling gaze with the former president. <br><br>“It was Little Miss Flint and Obama and her letter to him, when she was 8 years old asking him to fix the water. He did come to town and that started the national information on the water crisis and bringing attention to it. Then all of the reporters came,” said Branch.<br><br>The murals are made with a purpose. Their content is strongly influenced by what the community around wants and needs.<br><br>“We were able to go through there and put up inspirational murals and art that was diversified like the community. We weren&#x27;t just putting up anything to make ourselves feel better or look better, we were putting up things that gave a voice to the voiceless,” said Branch. <br><br>In the years following the beginning of the water crisis, the people of Flint were left with a strong mistrust in the government that failed them at every level. <br><br>“I would say the biggest thing is trust. You can ask a lot of folks in the city of Flint and they don&#x27;t trust government, they don&#x27;t trust that they have their best interests,” said Barber.<br><br>Foster shared a similar sentiment regarding the current day cleanliness of the water. <br><br>“That&#x27;s based on the trust, not so much of the actual water. It can already be that clean. I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m still not drinking it because they just lie so much. They done left us in a compromising situation… It makes you sick. It has killed people,” said Foster. <br><br>Many artists did not take the water crisis as a source of inspiration for their work like the Flint Public Art Project muralists did. <br><br>“It was enough articles about it. It was just such a negative thing that we all kind of tried to ignore it. Didn’t really highlight it like, ‘oh, this is an opportunity to throw out some great paintings,’” said Foster.<br><br>He also acknowledged art being used as a tool that has helped humanity move through crises. <br><br>“I know art has been used for centuries as a stop in time, so to speak… There&#x27;s always something that shows what was going on at that time. Renaissance, wars, what have you… But this water crisis wasn&#x27;t a real good art thing,” said Foster.<br><br>Foster joked about a potential painting that would portray his feelings of trust for the water.<br><br>“What would we really need to trust this water? And that&#x27;s Christ himself touching the water. You got that dirty, icky water and he&#x27;s touching it and that part he&#x27;s touching is clean and pure and sparkly,” laughed Foster.<br><br>Errin Whitaker, life-long Flint resident, artist and muralist for the Flint Public Art Project talked about how despite not producing much during the height of the crisis, the effect it had on him remains present in his messaging.<br><br>“I was too busy volunteering. I think more of the work that I create now is reflective, introspective. Just because you don&#x27;t do things in the moment doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not affecting you for years to come,” said Whitaker. <br><br>The Flint Public art project is attempting to continually evolve their messaging as the city moves into the future, while still reflecting on the city’s past. <br><br>“We&#x27;re doing murals that have to do with diversity, culture and healing. Getting back to nature and clean water of course. All that that brings with the clean water, which is clean water ways, fresher food and less poisoned gardens,” said Branch.<br><br>Could talk about Scraps here (has a lot of nature, water oriented pieces)<br><br>Reverberations of the water crisis are still felt throughout the city to this day. The effects of lead are irreversible, and there is nothing money or the government can do to change that.<br><br>“I would say we are still, to this day in 2025, dealing with the aftermath. Lead does not go away. Those that consumed the water and were essentially infected with lead, they are going to have lifelong repercussions. There are scientific studies out there that will show that they will never be the same or have the original potential that they had before,” said Barber.<br><br>Many of the city&#x27;s residents still want more to be done with regards to the water in Flint. <br><br>“You have people that have come in there and they did stuff during that time frame, but they stopped. I think it should still be resources that are poured into the city that will benefit the people for generations to come, because what they did to us… with the water crisis has impacted generations,” said Whitaker.<br><br>As Flint’s moves into the future, its artist community is striving for it to be known for more than just the water crisis. The word resilient is frequently used when describing the city’s people. <br><br>“We are a community of different cultures that get along. We are happy. We are talented. We are resilient. We are survivors. We are thrivers. We are innovators. That&#x27;s how we want to be seen. We want to be seen as taking our power back and not waiting for someone to give us anything, but snatching it from the jaws of life,” said Branch.<br></p><img src="../images/Cropped_Alaa1.2Feature-min.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 940px" srcset="../images/Cropped_Alaa1.2Feature-min-p-500.jpg 500w, ../images/Cropped_Alaa1.2Feature-min-p-800.jpg 800w, ../images/Cropped_Alaa1.2Feature-min-p-1080.jpg 1080w, ../images/Cropped_Alaa1.2Feature-min-p-1600.jpg 1600w, ../images/Cropped_Alaa1.2Feature-min-p-2000.jpg 2000w, ../images/Cropped_Alaa1.2Feature-min-p-2600.jpg 2600w, ../images/Cropped_Alaa1.2Feature-min.jpg 2768w" alt="">
