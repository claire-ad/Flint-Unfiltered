        <p class="text-paragraph">FLINT, MI – Adorned in her usual Sunday hairnet and ruby red kitchen apron, Aurora Sauceda eagerly waves at each family that packs into the bustling San Juan Diego Activity Center following 9 A.M. Spanish Mass. “I just feel the warmth. . . . Here, everybody comes together,” Sauceda says with a bright smile across her face, surrounded by steaming plates of pupusas and nopales con huevo. Amidst the giggles of young children in their Sunday best, the weekly bulletin—“Señor, ayúdame a dar buenos frutos este día,”—rings true, as the self-empowerment of Flint’s immigrant community bears good fruit in the face of a water crisis response that failed and continues to fail them. <br><br>With roots in Flint, Texas, and Mexico, Sauceda stands as the community coordinator and driving force of the organization Latinos United for Flint, born out of the water crisis on June 6, 2016. Her dedication to the Spanish-speaking community is not limited to the infamous water source switch, but it certainly served as a secondary call-to-action. <br><br>At the onset of the crisis, water distribution was set up at local fire stations, from Saginaw street to Fenton road, under the purview of the Michigan National Guard in early January 2016. Beyond general community pushback to the National Guard’s occupation of the city, a more critical concern was at hand for the Spanish-speaking community but more specifically, Flint’s undocumented residents. <br><br>In the attempt to ensure “it was just Flint people that were getting services,” water distribution centers required government identification to obtain water, says Jim Ananich, former Minority Leader of the Michigan Senate and current board member of the International Center of Flint. In response, in January 2016, the Michigan Senate waived the license requirement in order to streamline water accessibility for all Flint residents with the most direct target being the undocumented. “It was critical because we were going to miss a second part of the population that just is under the radar and also needs it,” says Ananich. <br><br>Yet, the fears within the undocumented community did not subside with the elimination of this identification barrier at water distribution centers. <br><br>Over the course of a ten day mission, more than <a href="https://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article/649010/most-michigan-national-guard-members-return-home-from-flint-water-assistance/">270</a> guardsmen along with the American Red Cross and local law enforcement delivered water and filters to over <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/flintwater/news/2016/01/20/photo-video-opportunity-today-additional-national-guard-members-join-water-response-teams">22,000 homes</a>. Despite intentions, aid canvassing while dressed in their pristine military garb and gilded badges did not serve as an effective response to a people whose necks are craned and shoulders strained in the wake of deportation threats. <br><br>“It’s unsettling to have this military presence coming up to your door, or law enforcement coming up to your door, when there’s just that whole history for people of color in the country,” says Asa Zuccaro, the Flint-local who stands as Executive Director of the Latinx Technology and Community Center on the city’s Eastside. <br><br>Turning away from state-run Points of Distribution (PODs), community centers such as Greater Holy Temple Church of God in Christ and Salvation Army of Genesee County rose to the occasion, operating under the umbrella of state assistance. However, due to Our Lady of Guadalupe residing in the district of Beecher, the church was not designated as one of the state-assisted distribution centers. “That was also another issue because this is where people feel comfortable coming and so this was the hub,” Sauceda says. <br><br>Following the expiration of Governor Rick Snyder’s state-funded PODs in April 2018, local foundations such as United Way and the Community Foundation sponsored these hubs to continue the dispersal of free water, as the Flint community remained fearful. As a result, in 2019, Sauceda and Our Lady of Guadalupe received $10,000 from United Way to purchase and distribute water to the Hispanic community on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays from 4-6pm. On one day in the summer of 2019—four years following the crisis’ onslaught—, Our Lady of Guadalupe dispensed 486 24-packs of water alone to 133 families, including both single and multi-member households. <br><br>But with daily servicing of nearly 11,664 plastic water bottles to a forgotten community, local pushback rolled in. “People found out and they said we were discriminating because we were not handing out water to other community people,” Sauceda says. “They were making comments that it was just because ‘we’re not hispanic and we don’t speak Spanish.’ . . . Can you believe that?” Sauceda says, her voice riddled with hilarious disbelief. <br><br>That same year, Flint’s population total reached <a href="https://www.cityofflint.com/wp-content/uploads/Flint_HousingMarketResearchReport_11-2021.pdf">95,538</a> with the Hispanic community chipping away a mere 4,299 individuals, or an approximate 4.5% of the city. But claims of discrimination still flew. <br><br>Eradication of IDs, elimination of threatening house visits, and the establishment of water distribution, and yet, a greater thorn is nestled in the side of Flint’s Hispanic community—language itself. <br><br>“Our Spanish-speaking and undocumented communities were really in the dark for a long time before they found out about the water crisis,” says Sauceda. “The English speaking were aware of it, but the Spanish speaking weren’t aware of it because they didn’t know what was going on. We had a case of a young lady who was pregnant while that happened. And her baby was affected by it.”<br><br>Some did not learn of the potentially lethal water contamination until April of 2016, an approximate two years after the infamous switch from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the Flint river and most notably, three months following Governor Rick Snyder’s declaration of a state of emergency. For two years and counting, murmurings of months-old boil advisories spun the community in circles, allowing the concentration of lead in the water to only condense further. <br><br>“There was no policy maker that was concerned about, ‘do we need to translate things into Spanish?’ That all had to happen through grassroots advocacy,” says Emily Feuerherm, a linguistics professor at the University of Michigan-Flint. “This idea that this city is American, this city is English speaking with some white people. It totally erased this entire other population and group of those with an immigrant background, multilingual background.”<br><br>The potency of this language barrier was littered with complexity, as inequity and government laxity continued to fester well-past the alertion of the hispanic community. <br><br>On February 24, 2016, Governor Snyder announced the Michigan State Legislature’s approval of a $30 million aid package to provide water credits to the city of Flint. Of the water portion of people’s bills, 65% would be reallocated to the pockets of Flint families for their accrued costs in drinking, cooking, and bathing in the defiled water. On November 16, 2016, the extension of the program until December 31, 2016 was announced, allowing residential and commercial customers to receive back pay on their bills up until April 2014. <br><br>Attached to the <a href="https://www.cityofflint.com/flint-officials-granted-extension-of-water-relief-credits-collection-effort-continues-on-past-due-accounts/">$12.75</a> million of aid within the Michigan state budget is a requirement of a 70% collection rate of water bills from residential and commercial customers in order for the Water Credit Program to continue until December 2016. By November 21, Flint residents who did not pay their water bills in full would suffer from late penalties and scheduled shutoffs, but most importantly, their eligibility to access the 65% relief credits would be retracted. Residents would receive this information in accompaniment with their utility bills in supposed explicit detail. That was most critically explained in English . . . only. <br><br>“They would have to call in and leave a message and because they were leaving a Spanish-speaking message, they didn’t understand it there, so nobody would get back to them,” Sauceda says. “Then, they weren’t transferring, they were not transferring calls to the department they needed to be.” <br><br>The Water Credit Program was penciled in the long-list of failed state paternalism in crisis’ fallout but not without extreme community pushback, especially under the Sauceda’s helm, raising these concerns with former Mayor Karen Weaver. <br><br>Now, the City of Flint houses four public health navigators in the Office of Public Health who are tasked with bilingual services, having been established in 2020. Though not a direct response to the circus of mishandling in the city’s Water Credit Program communications, it does serve as a potential safeguard against its recurrence. <br><br>Following previous footsteps of injustice, “all the applications were in English,” Sauceda says referencing the claimant forms for the $626 million lawsuit, which was approved in November 2021. “So they didn’t know how to fill them out. . . . I would say that hardly any of our undocumented, our Spanish people, got to even apply for the lawsuit.” The original deadline for registering as a claimant on the suit was March 29, 2021 with an extended and final deadline of June 30, 2022. Despite the lawsuit failing to yet provide financial justice to its nearly 27,000 claimants, an entire people were left to the wayside in the grasp at justice. <br><br>Similarly, applications with the Flint Registry, a community tool to measure and track the population in the years following the contamination of the water, are solicited in English with the opportunity to request a Spanish application. <br><br>“And I will be very honest, a lot of that is a funding situation in that sending a letter with all of the translations is a significant weight,” says Felicia Eshragh, Program Manager of the Flint Registry. “If you would like it to be translated, we can go from there.” <br><br>Of the 22,259 registrants within the program as of January 2025, 4.4% or an approximate 979 identify as Latinx or hispanic, marking a potential impression upon the community but certainly not in its entirety. <br><br>“There was absolute invisibility,” Feuerherm says. After conducting a community-based ESOL programme needs analysis on the Flint immigrant, Feuerherm came to understand the slight they feel as a result of the barrier. “People would come up to me, ‘thank you so much for talking to me. I have wanted to share ideas but haven’t ever had the opportunity. Nobody seems interested.’”<br><br>English as a Second Language (ESL) services within the city reflect this dwindling attention due to funding and negligence. In 2015, Professor Feuerherm spearheaded an ESL mapping project of the county, documenting a total of nine ESL programs within and around Flint. Of those nine, a total of four no longer offer said services, let alone to the hispanic community specifically. <br><br>Upon reflection of the public health disaster’s anniversary, “they were more vulnerable. It makes me wonder how they are faring now,” former Mayor Karen Weaver says. “That’s information I don’t even have. Those are some stories that we don’t know if anybody has heard, I haven’t heard them, and I’m right here, so who has heard their stories?” <br><br>Yet, “this city is tenacious,” Feuerherm says, as in the face of their forgotten experience, the hispanic immigrant community persists. <br><br>“Systems will fail you, they can fail you,” Zuccaro says. “Instead of waiting for a system to understand how to service and learn how to service, maybe we’ll do better. Just by serving ourselves and trying to create our own systems.”<br><br>And this is just what Zuccaro and his colleagues at Latinx strive to do. <br><br>Understanding the crisis’ impact upon “the brain and the capacity to learn new information” is an aspect that has truly “guided our work,” Zuccaro says, championing literacy programs and extensive ESL programming, Spanish as a Second Language (SSL) services, tutorials, and most importantly, youth advancement. <br><br>On March 14, the Latinx Center broke ground on its Bilingual Early Education Center while their first interpreter training program (TICT) session will kick off on April 14th of this year running up until June 29th. Just last year, the center translated over 268 hours of material and 169,604 words while also distributing 14,252 gallons of water to the culturally diverse Latin community that visits the center.<br><br>Beyond translational services, last year, the center oversaw 34 new LLC’s from the hispanic community and over 68 people became fully employed. “I think the exciting part is not only maybe staying in that labor force but now taking agency and becoming the business owner in that labor force,” Zuccaro says. <br><br>A spot of pride for the center is the over 20 competitive applications they have received for the Youth Leadership program, a program which enlists local youth to beautify the Eastside in a pre-established project, encouraging reinvestment within the hispanic and immigrant communities. <br><br>And that revitalization takes shape in the form of new arrivals, as the city’s East Side crackles with sanguinity these 10 years later. In the face of the general population’s 1.6% decline in 2021, Genesee County’s immigrant population jumped to approximately 11,269 with most journeying from Cuba, Mexico, and Venezuela. Much of the community is attracted to the low property values and cost of living within the county, specifically Flint, a remnant of the crisis.<br><br>“When they come here, it’s warm for them. They feel like family members too,” says Devianise Padilla Borgos, the Advancement Coordinator for the Latinx Center. “If they’re new in the community, they know this is the first spot.” <br><br>A similar thread of communal ambition and advancement dances about the mosaics of stained glass and the wise wooden pews of Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church. <br><br>For long-time Flint resident and one of the hands who helped build this latin church from the ground, 84 year-old Lucia Pacheco sees it as a matter of survival. <br><br>“The Church is keeping the Mexican, the Spanish-speaking people together. Otherwise, we wouldn’t see, we wouldn’t see a thing,” says Pacheco with a contagious force in her voice. Despite her diagnosis with stiff person syndrome which has almost immobilized her, her and her husband, Mr. Vincent Pacheco, walk through the doors of the church every Sunday. <br><br>From 10 a.m. to 11 a.m., after ten years, the halls of the San Juan Diego Activity Center are still beaming with food donations, distributing free bananas, milk, and most importantly, water cases to a forgotten but tenacious community. <br><br>“I just feel that we all have a purpose in life,” Sauceda says, her face softening at the sound of a beautiful mélange of Spanish and English. “And it can’t be just sitting on your hands and doing nothing.”<br></p><img src="../images/MaryRaines1Feature-min.JPG" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 940px" srcset="../images/MaryRaines1Feature-min-p-500.jpg 500w, ../images/MaryRaines1Feature-min-p-800.jpg 800w, ../images/MaryRaines1Feature-min-p-1080.jpg 1080w, ../images/MaryRaines1Feature-min-p-1600.jpg 1600w, ../images/MaryRaines1Feature-min-p-2000.jpg 2000w, ../images/MaryRaines1Feature-min-p-2600.jpg 2600w, ../images/MaryRaines1Feature-min-p-3200.jpg 3200w, ../images/MaryRaines1Feature-min.JPG 6000w" alt="">
